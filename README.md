# The Say Their Names Project
This README.md is a draft. It will be fleshed out as I complete the project.

This repository is a presentation of code from the Say Their Names Project, intended to make the whole process more easily replicable and reviewed. Say Their names is one sub-project in the larger [Virality of Racial Terror Project](https://viraltexts.org/2023/01/24/vrt/).

The linear steps:

1) unifying our data sources (see [01_unify_data_sources.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/say_their_names/blob/main/01_unify_data_sources.ipynb))
2) pulling search results from Chron Am (see [02_pull_search_results.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/say_their_names/blob/main/02_pull_search_results.ipynb))
3) scraping search results (see [03_scrape_search_results.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/say_their_names/blob/main/03_scrape_search_results.ipynb))
4) Enrich the dateset (see [https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/say_their_names/blob/main/04_enrich_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/say_their_names/blob/main/04_enrich_dataset.ipynb)

To understand the genesis of this project, you may want to review my draft version here: [https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/messing-around/tree/main/vrt_work/say_their_names](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/messing-around/tree/main/vrt_work/say_their_names). This draft version shows how the project involved numerous iterations, failed attempts, explorations, and non-linear processes. It contains journal entries alongside code and other resources. It's admittedly more convoluted, but I'm archiving the draft version because it's a resource for studying _processes_ in the digital humanities.
