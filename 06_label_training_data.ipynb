    "I was fortunate to have help in this regard since labelling data can take some time. To divvy up the task efficiently, I took the ten chunks of my training data–100 newspaper clippings apiece–and uploaded them to Github. Then I created 10 nearly identical Google Colab notebooks, one for each chunk. The only differences between these notebooks were the .csv files they reviewed and the filenames they saved.\n",

    "When you run the code in the following notebook, you will be prompted to label newspaper clippings. The goal is to identify if the clippings contain any reference to lynchings. The labelled data will then be used to fine-tune a BERT model to classify other clippings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please label the data in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- '__yes__' = yes, the clipping is entirely about a lynching\n",
    "- '__no__' = no, the clipping has nothing to do with lynchings\n",
    "- '__partial__' = part of the clipping is about a lynching, but not all of it\n",
    "- '__unknown__' = the clipping is in a language I can't read or the OCR is so bad it's hard to tell\n",
